\title{Highest averages method}
\usage{
highest_averages_method(party_votes, n_seats, divisors)
}
\arguments{
\item{party_votes}{vector with votes for each party}

\item{n_seats}{total number of seats}

\item{divisors}{sequence of divisors. If it's a single number, a sequence
is generated starting with it.}
}
\value{
The number of seats per party as a vector
}
\description{
Allocates seats proportionally for divisor methods.
}
\details{
The highest averages method requires the number of votes for each party to
be divided successively by a series of divisors. This produces a table of
quotients, or averages, with a row for each divisor and a column for each
party. The nth seat is allocated to the party whose column contains the nth
largest entry in this table, up to the total number of seats available.
