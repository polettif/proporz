#' Biproportional apportionment with data frames
#'
#' Method to proportionally allocate seatsamong parties/lists and
#' districts/regions/entities ("Doppelter Pukelsheim").
#'
#' Each party nominates a candidate list for every district. The voters vote for the
#' parties of their district. The seat allocation is calculated in two steps:
#'
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item In the so called \emph{upper apportionment} the number of seats for each party
#'   (over all districts) is determined.
#'   \item In the so called \emph{lower apportionment} the seats are distributed to the
#'   regional party list respecting the results from the upper apportionment.
#' }
#'
#' Parties failing to reach at least one aquorum have their votes set to zero.

#'

#'
#' @note The results from the upper apportionment are final results for the number of
#' the seats of one party (and analogically for the number of the seats of one region)
#' within the whole voting area, the lower apportionment will only determine in which

#' Effectively, the objective of the iterative process is to modify the regional divisors and

#' of their votes divided by both the regional and the party divisors which is then rounded
#' by the rounding method of the highest averages method used, and the sum of the seats of
#' all regional party lists of one party equals the number of seats computed in the upper
#' apportionment for that party, and the sum of the seats of all regional party lists of
#' one region equals the number of seats computed in the upper apportionment for that region.

#' The following two correction steps are executed until this objective is satisfied:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item modify the party divisors such that the apportionment within each party is correct with
#'   the chosen highest averages method,
#'   \item modify the regional divisors such that the apportionment within the region is correct
#'   with the chosen highest averages method.

#' @param M vote matrix
#' @param seats_cols number of seats per column (districts/regions), calculated
#'                   from upper_apportionment()
#' @param seats_rows number of seats per row (parties/lists), calculated
#'                   from upper_apportionment()
#' @param method Apportion method that defines how seats are assigned,
#'               see \link{proporz}. Note  that the iterative process is only
#'               guaranteed to terminate with "round" (Sainte-LaguÃ«/Webster method).
#'               It's also possible to provide a function that works like base::round(x)
#'               (i.e. can handle a matrix).

#' @note The iterative process in the lower apportionment is only guaranteed to terminate
