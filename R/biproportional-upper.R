#' Upper apportionment
#'
#' In the first step of biproportional apportionment parties are given seats according to the
#' sum of their votes across all districts.
#'
#' @param votes_matrix Vote count matrix with votes by party in rows and votes by district
#'   in columns.
#' @param district_seats Vector defining the number of seats per district. Must be the same
#'   length as `ncol(votes_matrix)`. Values are name-matched to `votes_matrix` columns if both
#'   are named. If the number of seats per district should be calculated according to the number
#'   of votes (not the general use case), a single number for the total number of seats can be
#'   used.
#' @param use_list_votes By default (`TRUE`) it's assumed that each voter in a district has
#'   as many votes as there are seats in a district. Thus, votes are weighted according to
#'   the number of available district seats with [weight_list_votes()]. Set to `FALSE` if
#'   `votes_matrix` shows the number of voters (i.e. they can only cast one vote for one
#'   party).
#' @param method Apportion method that defines how seats are assigned, see [proporz()]. Default
#'   is the SaintÃ«-Lague/Webster method.
#'
#' @seealso [biproporz()], [lower_apportionment()]
#'
#' @returns A named list with `district` seats (for `votes_matrix` columns) and `party` seats
#'   (for rows).
#'
#' @note The results from the upper apportionment define the number of seats for each party and
#'   the number of seats for each district for the whole voting area. The lower apportionment
#'   will only determine where (i.e. which district) the party seats are allocated. Thus, after
#'   the upper apportionment is done, the final strength of a party/district within the
#'   parliament is definite.
